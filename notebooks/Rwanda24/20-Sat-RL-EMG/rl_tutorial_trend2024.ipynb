    "#### Run locally as a Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "You can open the notebook in jupyter notebook or a locally hosted colab. To run locally, you can open a terminal window and download the code with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /.../TReND-CaMinA/notebooks/Rwanda24/20-Sat-RL\n",

    "# 0. What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to learning from rewards. For example, if you reward a dog for doing a trick by rewarding it with a treat whenever it performs the desired behavior, you are training the dog with RL. The RL problem is the problem of finding actions, through trial-and-error, that maximize future reward. RL can be applied to lots of different types of problems, with different available actions and differently defined rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./figures/rl_examples.png\" width=500></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining aspect of reinforcement learning problems is that the agent is learning from rewards. After the agent takes an action, it is not told whether or not it took the correct action, or what the correct action would have been (\"supervised learning\"). Instead it is given a reward: maybe it gets a reward of +1, or +10, or -10 for an action, and then has to figure out whether or not a more rewarding action exists by exploring its environment. This makes reinforcement learning really hard, especially in variable environments with sparse rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A minor point about terminology.* As a term, Reinforcement Learning sometimes has multiple meanings. It is sometimes used to refer to a set of problems -- whenever an agent or animal is learning about rewards with trial-and-error -- and other times used to refer to a set of solutions -- algorithms specifically developed to *solve* RL problems, like Q-Learning or SARSA (which we'll learn more about later). I think this often leads to confusing when encountering RL for the first time, especially in neuroscience, as the first interpretation describes a set of experiments and the second a specific hypotheses about how the brain might be solving them.

The `Agent` takes in the `observation` and the recent `reward`, updates its internal variables, and outputs a new `action`. These stages repeat in a loop indefinitely (or until the episode ends).\n",

    "## Incorporating future rewards into our plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many decisions are about optimizing for future reward, rather than immediate reward. For instance, deciding to submit an application for a summer school is accepting short term discomfort (writing an application) in exchange for long-term reward (the thrill of learning about computational neuroscience!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing we consider will be how to adapt the RL process to include future expected reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically modelled with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which capture an environment that has structure. An MDP contains multiple states, and actions influence not just reward but how the agent can transition through this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we illustrate an MDP with three states, and 2 actions that move the agent between states. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./figures/mdp.png\" width=500></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment is linear: the agent can transition from state $s_n$ can transition to state $s_{n+1}$ with action $a=0$ and $s_{n-1}$ with action $a=1$ (except at the boundaries, where the agent stays in place if $s_{n+1}$ or $s_{n-1}$ is out of limits). The agent receives reward at the rightmost state $s_{N-1}$ (given $N$ states). In our experiments, the agent will start at the leftmost state $s_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we construct an MDP environment `MDPEnv`. This environment is specified with a reward function (`reward_amounts`), transitions (`transitions`), as well as starting state `start_state` (and, optionally, absorbing states `absorb_states`). Here, we are assuming deterministic transitions, which means that the next state $s'$ is fully determined by current state $s$ and action $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also show an example MDPEnv with 4-states arranged linearly (as in the illustration above) called `FourStateLinearMDPEnv`. We also include `LinearMDPEnv` which sets up linear MDP environments for an arbitrary number of states.\n",

    "#### Exercise\n",
